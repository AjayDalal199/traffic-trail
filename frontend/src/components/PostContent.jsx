          website with relevant keywords for future reference, significantly
          aiding <span className="font-bold">off-page SEO</span> by increasing

          can be defined as an internet-based service that helps users store,
          classify, and tag bookmarks of websites or any other resources. Social
          bookmarks are not like the normal use of bookmarks in the browser
          where they are saved locally on the computer; bookmarks on social
          networks are saved on web applications so they are accessible from any
          computer that has an internet connection.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="mb-16">
          The other feature of bookmarks is that they can be easily labeled
          using tags or keywords to help users find materials easily. Many of
          the link sharing services provide a share option that lets users share
          their favorite links and help others discover content.
